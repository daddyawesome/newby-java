# newby-java

I am learning Java Starting today Jan 25, 2021. This is the first time I touch JAVA.

I am into Python but never before touch JAVA because it looks difficult but today I am trying to challenge myself to be a JAVA newby

I had been studying Python and Javascript for more than three years now but I am stuck in tutorals hell. I feel like there is nothing that wou;d stick to my head.

I rememeber that I had JAVA when I was in College that is way more than 20 years ago and I had to go back to that time when I was studying this and I am back to square one.

I wish that with this I will master this JAVA.

My goal is to at least to create my own JAVA APP from scratch and also escape myself from tutorial hell

## 
Things I shoul Follow on my JAVA Journey

1.  ****Strictly practice:**** [****CodeAcademy****](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)

This is probably one of the best-known online platforms for learning numerous languages. Of course, there’s a section for Java learners, too. Here you start coding from the first lesson. There are pretty useful hints, which you can get if a certain task seems to be tough (which is normal when you are a beginner). The logic is simple: read the task, write code and run it to see what happens as a result, and then move to the next step. The tasks gradually become more complicated, until you start to write your code from a clean sheet. The FAQ section is pretty useful and you have an option to discuss each task with other students.

This course can be a great complementary tool in learning Java. As told before, you need to code to master Java programming.

****2. Play and code from the beginning:**** [****CodeGym.cc****](https://codegym.cc/)

These are online courses for Java learners with a special feature — gamification. Nowadays it’s common for online courses to adopt gamified elements, as they bring instant motivation, a sense of constant achievements and make it easier to reach your goal.

At CodeGym’s you start from level 0 in the futuristic universe with space travel, robots, and other cool things. Your aim is to pass four educational quests to level up a character — a robot. Each quest includes 10 levels, and each level has up to 10–12 lessons, taught by crew members of a galactic ship. A lesson consists of a minimum theory and a set of tasks with instant verification and tips on how to improve your code. You start coding from the beginning, solving very simple tasks, until you’re ready for much more complicated and massive coding projects.

The whole story allows you not to get stuck on a certain subject or task, move forward and return later to the “twisters”. All in all, there are impressive 1200+ tasks in a course. An amount that converts in at least 300–500 hours of coding.

****3. Challenge programmers:**** [****Codewars****](https://www.codewars.com/)

This is another online platform with tons of practice. Though it’s more suitable for learners with at least a small background in programming. Codewars empower you to sharpen skills in a certain language by training katas.

You can write your code in a browser and use test cases to check it step by step. You can also compare your solution with others to broaden your knowledge and discuss the best practices. Each kata has a rank, and each kata is a challenge with other programmers. When you solve more difficult tasks, you can get more complicated challenges to improve coding skills. What differs this platform from others is that it allows to study and practice in a group.

****4. Listen to the lectures of a “pro” level:**** [****EdX****](https://www.edx.org/learn/java)

EdX is an educational platform founded by Harvard University and MIT. It covers many fields of study, including Java programming and many related subjects. There are plenty of verified introductory courses and certificate programs, provided by universities.

Each course has a defined time frame and includes video lectures with a text transcript. It’s easy to return to previous lessons and revise the material. There are dozens of different courses, some of them are free. But still, this is a source strictly for learning Java theory. Be sure to strengthen those courses with hours of coding.

Want to stay tuned to the latest news, reviews and updated in Java world? That’s the right thing to do. Java is constantly evolving, upgrading and bringing new features. Be sure to have a couple of media you can read daily. One of the largest are:

-   [Javaworld](https://www.javaworld.com/)  (news, useful tutorials, “how to’s” and everything else to keep you up to date with Java programming);
-   [Java Code Geeks](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/)  (a resource center for those who learn Java with educational tutorials, articles, and tips on how to get a job as a Java programmer);
-   [DZone](https://dzone.com/java-jdk-development-tutorials-tools-news)  (plenty of articles and guides for beginners and experienced developers);
-   [Javarevisited](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/)  (a daily updated blog which covers numerous Java learning topics).

Do you remember the advice to join a community to make your education more effective? You can ask any question in  [Stack Overflow’s](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java)  Java section or  [Coderanch](https://coderanch.com/c/java). Also, there are at least three large communities on Reddit, like[learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/), [java](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/)  and [learnjava](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/), where you will find useful tips on learning Java and programming in general. If you need more specific information, for example, a hint on improving your code in the certain tasks, try the special  [help section](https://codegym.cc/help)  at CodeGym, where other students and “coding coaches” will help you with any problem. And finally, Oracle has a vast  [Java Community](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/community/index.html), open for both the newcomers and experienced developers.
